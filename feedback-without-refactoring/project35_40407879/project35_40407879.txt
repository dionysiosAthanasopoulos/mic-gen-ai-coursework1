Explanation of the feedback on your 'Pruning Microservice Dendrogram'.

1. The percentage of the XML tags of your UML specification that have the correct case sensitive names is the following: 61.05%
	This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of correct tag names by the number of expected tag names.
	Please refer to the corresponding lecture presentation where the expected way of specifying the design of microservices in UML is presented.
	The differences between the tag names of your microservices and the tag names of the microservices of the model answer are the following:
	[232.0 correct tag(s) / 380.0 expected (in the model answer) tag(s) = 61.05%, The following (opening/closing) tags are missing: [local, par, dName, isStatic, met], The following (opening/closing) tag is used 42 times, 34 less time(s) than the 76 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: name, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 4 times, 4 less time(s) than the 8 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: ser, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 4 times, 8 less time(s) than the 12 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: pack, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 34 times, 12 less time(s) than the 46 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: access, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 38 times, 18 less time(s) than the 56 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: cName, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 18 times, 10 less time(s) than the 28 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: attr, The following (opening/closing) tag is used 18 times, 10 less time(s) than the 28 times that is expected to be used in the model answer: inName]

	The points you collected from the XML tags of the UML specification are the following: 6.11 out of 10.0


2. The percentage of the declarations of your UML specification that have the correct case sensitive values (and absolute path names) is the following: 32.79%
	This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of correct declarations by the number of expected declarations.
	Please refer to the corresponding chapters where the expected way of specifying the design of microservices in UML is presented.
	The differences between the declarations of your microservices and the declarations of the microservices of the model answer are the following:
	[40.0 correct declaration(s) / 122.0 expected (in the model answer) declaration(s) = 32.79%, The following declarations are missing (the microservice numbers correspond to the microservices of the model answer that is provided at the end of the document): [mic6.part1.Controller.Controller.engineers, mic70.part2, mic70.part4.Project, java.util.ArrayList, mic6.part1.Controller.Controller, DEPENDENCY, mic76.part3.Engineers, COMPOSITION, mic6.part1.Controller.Controller.unknown, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber.P_4, mic70.part4.Project.projectNumber, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber.P_5, mic76.part3.Engineers.engineers, mic4.part1.Role.ARCHITECT, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber.P_1, mic70.part2.Architect.projectNumbers, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber.P_2, mic4.part1.Role.ENGINEER, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber.P_3, mic6.part1.Controller.Controller.role, mic76.part3.Engineer, mic76.part4.ProjectNumber, mic6.part1.Controller.Controller.architects, mic76.part3.Engineer.projects, mic76.part3, mic76.part3.Engineer.projectNumbers, mic76.part4], The following declaration is defined 1 times, 1 less time(s) than the 2 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'mic1.part1', The following declaration is defined 8 times, 8 less time(s) than the 16 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'PUBLIC', The following declaration is defined 2 times, 6 less time(s) than the 8 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'mic1.part1.Role', The following declaration is defined 7 times, 6 more time(s) than the 1 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'ASSOCIATION', The following declaration is defined 4 times, 1 less time(s) than the 5 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'mic2.part2.Architects', The following declaration is defined 4 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineers', The following declaration is defined 8 times, 2 more time(s) than the 6 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'mic2.part2.Architect', The following declaration is defined 9 times, 2 more time(s) than the 7 time(s) that is expected to be defined in the model answer: 'PRIVATE', The following declaration is defined 3 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'AGGREGATION', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Architect.id', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Architect.int', The following declaration is defined 4 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Project', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Architect.ProjectNumber', The following declaration is defined 4 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.ProjectNumber', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineers.engineers', The following declaration is defined 7 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineer', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineer.id', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineer.int', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineer.projects', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Engineer.projectNumbers', The following declaration is defined 1 time(s) but it is not expected (in the model answer) to be defined at all: 'mic2.part2.Project.projectNumber']

	The points you collected from the declarations of the UML specification are the following: 9.84 out of 30.0


3. The percentage of the microservices of your UML specification that are correctly defined and contain the expected classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) is the following: 50.0%
	This percentage is calculated as the harmonic mean of the minimality and completeness of the classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of your microservices with respect to the expected microservices.
	Please see the formal definition of the harmonic mean of the minimality and the completeness of the UML design of microservices at this Web link: http://ksiresearchorg.ipage.com/seke/seke24paper/paper053.pdf.
	The minimality of the classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of your microservices compared against the classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of the microservices of the model answer is calculated as follows:
	['mic2' (minimality): 3 correct class name(s) / 6 class name(s) (in your answer) = 50.0%, The following class name(s) should not be included in 'mic2': [Engineers, Engineer, ProjectNumber], 'mic1' (minimality): 1 correct class name(s) / 2 class name(s) (in your answer) = 50.0%, The following class name(s) should not be included in 'mic1': [Controller], The AVERAGE of all percentages (we first convert all these percentages in the interval [0, 1]) that contribute to the minimality percentage is the following = 50.0% (we divide the sum of the percentages of the matched microservices with the number of your 2 microservices)]
	The completeness of the classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of your microservices compared against the classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of the microservices of the model answer is calculated as follows:
	['mic2' (completeness): 3 correct class name(s) / 3 expected class name(s) (in the model answer) = 100.0%, 'mic1' (completeness): 1 correct class name(s) / 1 expected class name(s) (in the model answer) = 100.0%, The AVERAGE of all percentages (we first convert all these percentages in the interval [0, 1]) that contribute to the completeness percentage is the following = 50.0% (we divide the sum of the percentages of the matched microservices with the number of the 4 microservices of the model answer)]

	The points you collected from classes (including the case sensitive name of classes) of the microservices of your UML specification are the following: 30.0 out of 60.0

The total similarity degree of your microservices compared to the microservices of the model answer is the following: 45.94 out of 100.0
